## Zustand global state management example

Zustand is a simple state management library for React. Compared to Redux it's very straightforward and easy to set up.  
This is a simple example demonstrating the shared state between the main `App.js` file and other components, in the same file and in separate files.  
  
Main files to look into in `/src`: `App.js`, `State.js`, `Bears.jsx`
